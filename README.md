 - 👋 Hi, I’m @ComputerMaverick69 - Timmy Iwoni
- 👀 I enjoy building APIs and Backends for applications
- 👀 I enjoy building Mobile Applications and Software Systems
- 🌱 I love PHP Laravel so much, They are my Language and Framework of choice.
- 👌 I'm really interested in the blockchain technology that I find myself making reserches concernig how to use it in solving local problems.
- 😍 I would also want to mention this special project that I was a part of - <b>iQuest</b>, you would check it out here <b>https://iquest.com.ng</b>
- 🎍 My goal is simple: build solutions to the problems I've been exposed to and find joy in seeing people using it, when it's actually solving a problem.
- 🙃 I have a target of building a really useful Laravel Package before the end of 2022, I want other developers to use some piece of my code as I've had the privilege to use others'.
- 💞️ When I'm not coding, I'm writing poetry or a short story, or you might find me playing the guitar
- 📫 You can reach me on <a href="https://wa.me/2348130138694" target="_blank">Whatsapp</a> or through my website <b>https://reevatech.africa </b>
